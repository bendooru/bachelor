\section{Computing Tropical Varieties}

Tropical geometry is a relatively new field in mathematics that arises from numerous
contexts and connects various branches of mathematics in exciting and novel ways. We shall
provide a basic introduction to this topic while focusing on the computational aspects
which will lead to main interest of this thesis -- the recently developed techniques using
Newton polygons and valuations.

Over the course of this section we need some basic definitions from algebraic geometry: We
fix a field $K$ which is usually assumed to be algebraically closed: The \emph{affine
space} over $K$ of dimension $n$ is
\[
  \setA_K^n = \setA^n = \{ (a_1,\dots,a_n) : a_i \in K\} = K^n
\]
and the \emph{projective space} over $K$ of dimension $n$ is $\setP^n_K = \setP^n =
(K^{n+1}\setminus\{0\})/\sim$ with equivalence relation $v \sim \lambda v$ for all $v \in
K^n\setminus \{0\}$ and $\lambda \in K^*$. Elements $a \in \setP^n$ are usually written as
homogeneous coordinates $(a_1:\cdots:a_n)$ for a representative $(a_0, \dots, a_n)$. An
\emph{affine variety} is the common zero locus of all the polynomials of a polynomial
ideal $I \idealof K[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, that means sets of the form
\[
  X := V(I) = \{ a \in \setA^n : f(a) = 0 \text{ for all $f\in I$} \} \subset \setA^n.
\]
In the special case of a homogeneous ideal $I \idealof K[x_0,\dots,x_n]$, which means $I$
is generated by homogeneous polynomials -- we may define \emph{projective varieties}
\[
  X = V(I) = \{ (a_0:\cdots:a_n) \in \setP^n : f(a_0, \dots, a_n) = 0
    \text{ for all $f \in I$}
  \} \subset \setP^n.
\]
The homogeneity assumption is necessary since otherwise $f(a)$ being zero is not
independent from the representative $a$ of $a\in \setP^n$.

\subsection{Basic Tropical Geometry and Tropical Prevarieties}

The standard approach to tropical geometry is to consider the semiring $(\setR \cup
\{\infty\}, \min, +)$ with the classical addition replaced with taking the minimum and
classical multiplication replaced with addition. An in-depth introduction to tropical
geometry and tropical varieties is given by \cite{sturmMacTrop}, similar notions focused
on computation can be found in \cite{compTropVar}.

We denote by $\oplus$ and $\odot$ the \enquote{addition} and \enquote{multiplication}
defined above, so -- just to reiterate -- we have that
\[
  x \oplus y = \min(x,y)
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  x \odot y = x+y
\]
for elements $x,y\in \setR\cup\{\infty\}$, for example $4\oplus9 = 4$ and $4\odot9 = 13$.
It is easy to verify that the usual arithmetic laws are still valid: $\oplus$ and $\odot$
are commutative and satisfy distributivity. Further, there is a unique neutral  element
for both operations: For all $x\in \setR\cup \{\infty\}$ it is true that
\[
  x \oplus \infty = x
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  x \odot 0 = x.
\]
As in proper rings, the neutral element of $\oplus$ has the annihilating property with
respect to $\odot$, i.e.\ $x\odot \infty = \infty$. An important property of this set is
that, while elements in $\setR$ admit a multiplicative $\odot$-inverse (the traditional
additive inverse), there is in general no additive $\oplus$-inverse. For example the
equation $4\oplus x = 5$ clearly has no solution. In this setting all ring axioms except
the existence of an additive inverse are satisfied: Sets like this are in fact called
semirings, hence we call $(\setR\cup \{\infty\}, \oplus, \odot)$ the \emph{tropical
semiring} which is sometimes also referred to a as the \emph{min-plus algebra}. By
replacing taking minima with maxima, we obtain the isomorphic max-plus algebra which is
also used as the underlying structure in tropical geometry by some authors. These special
operations of addition and multiplication naturally lead to the notion of polynomials over
the tropical semiring.

\begin{definition}[Tropical Polynomials]
  Let $x_1, \dots, x_k$ be variables with values in $\setR\cup\{\infty\}$, then due to
  commutativity we can write arbitrary products of variables as
  \[
    x_{i_1} \odot x_{i_2} \odot \cdots \odot x_{i_m}
    = x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots x_k^{\alpha_k}
  \]
  for suitable $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k \in \setN$. Unsurprisingly we call this a
  \emph{tropical monomial}. Translating back into the traditional operations shows that
  the tropical monomials
  \[
    x_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots x_k^{\alpha_k} =
    \underbrace{x_1\odot\cdots\odot x_1}_{\alpha_1 \text{ times}}
    \odot\cdots\odot
    \underbrace{x_k\odot\cdots\odot x_k}_{\alpha_k \text{ times}}
    = \alpha_1x_1 + \cdots \alpha_kx_k
  \]
  are just linear polynomials with integer coefficients. A \emph{tropical polynomial} is
  then just a finite $\setR$-linear combination of tropical monomials:
  \[
    p = a_1 \odot x_1^{\alpha_{1,1}}\cdots x_k^{\alpha_{1,k}} \oplus \cdots \oplus
    a_m \odot x_1^{\alpha_{m,1}}\cdots x_k^{\alpha_{m,k}}
  \]
  with exponents $\alpha_{i,j} \in \setN$, $1\leq i \leq m, 1\leq j \leq k$ and real
  coefficients $a_i \in \setR$. Note that if $a_i = 0$ for some $i$ we have that $a_i\odot
  x_1^{\alpha_{i,1}}\cdots x_k^{\alpha_{i,k}} = x_1^{\alpha_{i,1}}\cdots
  x_k^{\alpha_{i,k}}$ so we can omit $0$-coefficients. As usual, we call a monomial in $p$
  together with its coefficient a \emph{term}.
  \label{def:tropPoly}
\end{definition}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Graph of the tropical polynomial $p=x^2\oplus 2\odot x \oplus 5$}
  \label{fig:tropPolyPlot}
\end{figure}

By again translating back to the traditional operations, evaluating this polynomial at
elements in $\setR^k$ yields a function
\[
  p : \setR^k \to \setR, (x_1, \dots, x_k) \mapsto
  \min\left\{
    a_i + \sum_{j=1}^k \alpha_{i,j}x_j : 1 \leq i \leq m
  \right\}
\]
which is continuous, piecewise linear with finitely many pieces and concave, meaning that
for any $a,b \in \setR^k$ the equality $p(\frac12(a+b)) \geq \frac12(p(a)+p(a))$ holds.
Consider for example the polynomial $p = x^2 \oplus 2\odot x \oplus 5$ in the single
variable $x$. As we see in figure~\ref{fig:tropPolyPlot}, each monomial of $p$ corresponds
to a linear piece of the graph and the function $p$ is in fact concave.

With the newly established notion of tropical polynomials the next step towards defining
tropical varieties is to consider special sets $X \subset \setR^k$ induced by a tropical
polynomial. Whereas the main object of study in classical algebraic geometry are the roots
or vanishing loci of polynomials and -- by extension -- polynomial ideals, being zero is
not a particularly interesting property of a tropical polynomial. Similarly, evaluating to
the additive identity is equally uninteresting: If $p$ is not already the constant
$\infty$-function, then $p(x)=\infty$ if and only if $x=\infty$. Instead, we use the fact
that the induced function is piecewise linear:

\begin{definition}[Tropical Hypersurface]
  Let $p = a_1 \odot x_1^{\alpha_{1,1}}\cdots x_k^{\alpha_{1,k}} \oplus \cdots \oplus
  \alpha_m \odot x_1^{\alpha_{m,1}}\cdots x_k^{\alpha_{m,k}}$ be a tropical polynomial in the
  variables $x_1, \dots, x_k$ with induced piecewise linear function $p:\setR^k \to
  \setR$. For an element $a\in \setR^k$ the value $p(a)$ is the minimum over the terms of
  $p$; we set
  \[
    V(p) = \left\{
      a \in \setR^k :
      \text{ the minimum $p(a)$ is attained by at least two terms of $p$}
    \right\}
  \]
  and call it the \emph{tropical hypersurface} of $p$. Equivalently, a point $a\in
  \setR^k$ lies in $V(p)$ if and only if $p$ is not linear at $a$. With this
  interpretation in mind, the set $V(p)$ is also called the \emph{corner locus} of $p$.
  \label{def:tropHypersurface}
\end{definition}

Again looking at the tropical polynomial $p$ plotted in figure~\ref{fig:tropPolyPlot} we
see that $p$ is not linear at precisely the points $V(p) = \{ 2, 3 \}$. An interesting
property is that by this definition the tropical hypersurface given by a monomial contains
no points whatsoever. This will become important later on.

  \begin{tikzpicture}[thick]
    \draw (0,0) -- (2,2);

  \end{tikzpicture}
  and quadric
  % TODO
  \caption{A generic tropical line and quadric in $\setR^2$}
  \label{fig:tropLineQuad}
\end{figure}

Since monomials and powers of variables are well-defined, we can assign a \emph{degree} to
a tropical polynomial in the usual sense, hence we may carry over the naming conventions
for hypersurfaces in standard algebraic geometry: A hypersurface given by a degree 1
polynomial is called a tropical hyperplane, for degrees 2, 3 and so on they are called
tropical quadrics and cubics respectively.

\subsection{Gröbner Fans}

One way of looking at the tropical variety of a polynomial ideal $I \idealof K[x_1, \dots,
x_n]$ is to first consider its Gröbner fan. This fan partitions the space $\setR^n$ into
polyhedral cones which contain all weight vectors $w\in \setR^n$ that define the same
initial ideal of $I$. While this fan is a highly interesting object of study in and on
itself, by restricting the fan to those cones which correspond to monomial-free initial
ideals, we obtain the tropical variety of the given ideal.

We start off this section with some basic definitions from convex geometry which will lead
to the definition of the Gröbner fan of an ideal. This will then allow us to define
tropical varieties and demonstrate their connection to the Gröbner fan. For this we mainly
focus on definitions and results found in \cite{compGrobFan} and \cite{SturmGBCP}. The
first step towards defining a fan is to understand the very important concept of polyhedra
and polyhedral cones:

\begin{definition}[Polyhedral Cones]
  Recall that a set of the form $C = \{ x \in \setR^n : Ax \leq b \}$ for some matrix $A
  \in \Mat(m\times n, \setR)$ and $b \in \setR^m$ is called a polyhedron and if
  additionally $C$ is bounded it is called a polytope. If on the other hand $b=0$ then $C$
  is called a \emph{polyhedral cone}. Equivalently, a polyhedral cone $C$ is the positive
  span of finitely many vectors in $\setR^n$.
  \label{def:polyhedralCone}
\end{definition}

For a polyhedron $P \subseteq \setR^n$ we further define its dimension as the dimension of
the smallest affine linear space containing $P$. Consider now an element $w \in \setR^n$,
then we define the set $\face_w(P) = \{ u \in P : \ideal{w,u} \geq \ideal{w,v} \text{ for
all } v\in P\}$ where $\ideal{\cdot,\cdot}$ is the standard scalar product on $\setR^n$.
Surprisingly enough, we call a subset of $P$ of the form $\varnothing$ or $\face_w(P)$ a
\emph{face} of $P$. For example, the trivial faces of $P$ are $\varnothing$ by definition
and $P = \face_0(P)$. Clearly, a face of $P$ is a polyhedron itself, so we call it a facet
if it has dimension exactly one less than $P$. The notion of faces is important for the
next definition:

\begin{definition}[Polyhedral Fan]
  Let $\mathcal C$ be a collection of polyhedra in $\setR^n$. We call $\mathcal C$ a
  \emph{polyhedral complex} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item all non-empty faces of $P$ are in $\mathcal C$ for all $P \in \mathcal C$ and
    \item for any $P,Q \in \mathcal C$ the intersection $P\cap Q$ is a face of both $P$
      and $Q$.
  \end{enumerate}
  The support of $\mathcal C$ is $\bigcup_{P\in\mathcal C}P$ and we call $\mathcal C$ a
  \emph{polyhedral fan} if all polyhedra in $C$ are polyhedral cones. Furthermore, if the
  support of a polyhedral fan is all of $\setR^n$ we call it \emph{complete}.
  \label{def:polyhedralFan}
\end{definition}

Intuitively, a polyhedral complex is a collection of polyhedra where intersecting
arbitrary elements does not produce new polyhedra and -- more importantly -- if the
intersection of two such polyhedra is a non-trivial face of both of them, they only
\enquote{touch}.

\subsection{Newton Polygon Method}

We focus on a new approach introduced by Yue Ren and Tommy Hofmann which uses Newton
polygons to compute tropical varieties \cite{tropPointsLinks}. For this we fix an
algebraically closed field $K$ with non-trivial valuation $v:K\to\setR \cup \{\infty\}$
and residue field $\mathfrak R$, i.e. $\mathfrak R = R/\mathfrak m_R$ for the local ring
$R = \{ x \in K : v(x) \geq 0 \}$, with a uniformizing parameter $p\in \mathcal O_K$.
Denote $K[\vec x] = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

% TODO

\begin{definition}[Initial Forms and Tropical Varieties]
  Let $w \in \setR^n$, usually called a \emph{weight vector} and consider a polynomial $f
  \in K[\vec x]$ of the form $f = \sum_{\alpha \in \setN^n} c_\alpha \cdot \vec x^\alpha$.
  We define the \emph{initial form} of $f$ with respect to $w$ as
  \[
    \initial_w(f) = \sum_{w\alpha + \nu(c_\alpha) \text{ minimal}}
    \overline{c_\alpha \cdot p^{-\nu(c_\alpha)}} \cdot x^\alpha
    \in \mathfrak K[\vec x].
  \]
  Given an ideal $I \idealof K[\vec x]$ this naturally leads to the \emph{initial ideal}
  $\initial_w(I) = \ideal{\initial_w(f) : f\in I}$ of $I$. Finally, we may define the
  \emph{tropical variety}
  \[
    \Trop(I) := \{ w \in \setR^n \mid \initial_w(I) \text{ is monomial-free} \}.
  \]
  of $I$.
  \label{def:tropicalVarietyVal}
\end{definition}

% TODO
The definition given in \ref{def:tropicalVarietyVal} is the standard definition of
tropical varieties used in the general algorithms, however in this thesis we want to
consider a different formulation of this object. The following result is fundamental to
our approach to the computation of tropical varieties:

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Tropical Geometry]
  Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field with non-trivial valuation and $p\in \mathcal
  O_K$ as above. Then
  \[
    \Trop(I) = \overline{v(V(I) \cap (K^\ast)^n)},
  \]
  where $\overline{(\cdot)}$ denotes the closure in the Euclidean topology.
  % TODO
  \label{thm:fundamentalThmTropicalGeometry}
\end{theorem}

This together with our results on Newton polygons allows us to determine points in
$\Trop(I)$ without having to explicitly compute points on $V(I)$.

\subsection{Puiseux Series Rings and Puiseux Expansions}

While we did not specify the field $K$ in the previous subsection, our algorithms
explicitly deal with the field $K = \CCt$ of Puiseux series in the indeterminate
$t$. While the computations using Newton polygons only depend on the valuation of ring
elements, in some rare cases these methods can fail to produce a result, thus requiring us
to actually compute the variety of a zero-dimensional ideal. Hence we study this field and
its polynomial rings in greater detail.

First goal: slight refactoring of existing \textsc{Singular} code and removing dependency on
Magma. Use newly developed procedures for computing Puiseux expansions.

\section{Parallelization}

Use Petri nets as a framework to parallelize the traversal of tropical fans.

\subsection{Traversing a Fan in Parallel}

Computing tropical varieties in our setting follows the general structure of a fan
traversal: Interpreting the maximal cones of a polyhedral fan together with their
adjacency relations as a connected graph, we may realize the fan traversal as a simple
graph traversal.

We formulate the traversal algorithm into a Petri net.

Standard approach relying on a starting cone procedure and a \emph{neighbour oracle}.

\subsection{Tropical Grassmannians}

One important class of tropical varieties are the tropical Grassmannians which arise as
the tropical varieties of the equally -- if not more -- important Grassmannians which can
be interpreted as projective varieties. Some results on the tropical Grassmannian can be
found in \cite{tropGrass}.

\begin{definition}[Grassmannians]
  Let $n \in \setN_{>0}$ and $k \in \setN$ with $0 \leq k \leq n$, then the
  \emph{Grassmannian} of $k$-planes in $K^n$ is the set of all $k$-dimensional linear
  subspaces of $K^n$, usually denoted by $G(k, n)$.
\end{definition}

Thus, Grassmannians are in some sense a generalization of projective space and for example
we will later be able to show that in fact $G(1,n) \cong \setP^n$. Our goal now is to
give these sets the structure of a projective variety which in turn allows us to study their
tropical variety which is achieved by embedding a Grassmannian $G(k, n)$ into $\setP^{\binom
nk}-1$ via the so-called \emph{Plücker embedding}. To this end we want to regard the
corresponding linear spaces as elements of projective space, which first require some
constructions from commutative algebra.

Let $V$ and $W$ be two vector spaces and $k\in\setN$, then a multilinear map $f : V^k \to
W$ is called \emph{alternating} if for all $v_1, \dots, v_k$ with $v_i=v_j$ for some
distinct $i,j$ we have that $f(v_1, \dots, v_k) = 0$. In this setting an \emph{alternating
$k$-fold tensor product} of $V$ is a vector space $T$ together with an alternating map
$\wedge:V^k\to T, (v_1, \dots, v_k) \mapsto v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k$ such that for any
other alternating map $f:W\to T$ there is a unique $\tilde f:T\to W$ such that $\tilde f
\circ \wedge = f$. It is easy to prove that such an alternating tensor product always
exists and is in fact unique up to isomorphism -- the proof is completely analogous to the
case of standard tensor products. Hence we may write $\bigwedge^k V := T$ for these vector
spaces. In the following we present some interesting and necessary properties of these
spaces which can be proved with basic knowledge of commutative algebra:

\begin{remark}
  Let $V$ be a vector space, $k \in \setN$ and $\bigwedge^k V$ the corresponding
  alternating tensor product.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $v_1, \dots, v_n$ is a basis of $V$ where $n=\dim V$ as a $K$-vector space,
      then the set
      \[
        \left\{
          v_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge v_{i_k} : 1\leq i_1 < \cdots < i_k \leq n
        \right\}
      \]
      will be a basis of $\bigwedge^kV$. In particular we have $\dim\bigwedge^kV = \binom
      nk$.
    \item For elements $v_1, \dots, v_k \in V$ the \emph{pure tensor} $v_1\wedge \cdots
      \wedge v_k \in \bigwedge^kV$ will be non-zero if and only if $v_1, \dots, v_k$ are
      linearly independent in $V$.
    \item It follows that for two linear independent families $v_1, \dots, v_k, w_1,
      \dots, w_k \in V$ we have that $v\wedge\cdots \wedge v_k$ and $w_1\wedge\cdots\wedge
      w_k$ are linearly dependent if and only if the families both span the same linear
      subspace of $V$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

Consider now our setting where $V=K^n$ and let $N = \binom nk$ be the number of basis
elements in $\bigwedge^kK^n$. We may identify a $k$-dimensional linear subspace $X \in
G(k,n)$ of $V$ with a pure tensor in $\bigwedge^kV \cong K^N$ uniquely up to scalar
multiplication which -- by definition -- makes the corresponding embedding $G(k,n) \to
\setP^{N-1}$, called the \emph{Plücker embedding}, injective. Hence we can regard $G(k,n)$
as a subset of this projective space. Finally, to equip $G(k,n)$ with the structure of a
projective variety, we need this fact: For non-zero $w\in \bigwedge^kK^n$ the rank of the
$K$-linear map $f:K^n \to \bigwedge^{k+1}K^n, v \mapsto v \wedge w$ is at least $n-k$ and
equality holds if and only if $w$ is a pure tensor. Thus, using the above embedding,
$G(k,n)$ consists entirely of pure tensors $w\in G(k,n)$ which all define maps $v\mapsto
v\wedge w$ of rank at most $n-k$. This is equivalent to all $(n-k+1) \times
(n-k+1)$-minors of these maps vanishing which induces polynomial equations in the Plücker
coordinates of $\setP^{N-1}$ describing $G(k,n)$, hence it is in fact a projective
variety.

On an additional note one can cover $G(k,n)$ with copies of $K^{k(n-k)}$ to show that the
Grassmannian is an irreducible projective variety of dimension $k(n-k)$. This leads to the
following definition:

\begin{definition}[Tropical Grassmannians]
  By the above a Grassmannian can be viewed as a projective variety given by a homogeneous
  ideal
  \[
    I(G(k,n)) \idealof K[ p_{i_1, \dots, i_k} : 1\leq i_1 < \cdots < i_k \leq n ]
  \]
  with Plücker coordinates $p_{i_1,\dots,i_k}$ which defines a determinantal variety $G(k,
  n)$. We write $\mathcal G_{k,n} := \Trop(I(G(k,n)))$.
\end{definition}
